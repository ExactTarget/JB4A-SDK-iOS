For CloudPage-only Messages, the JB4A SDK will download new messages each time your app comes into the foreground.

You must configure your app to display these messages. The SDK provides an interface for you to use to allow your customers to view CloudPage-only messages sent from the Salesforce Marketing Cloud directly to the app. The inbox in the app displays these messages, and the app displays no alert for these messages.
