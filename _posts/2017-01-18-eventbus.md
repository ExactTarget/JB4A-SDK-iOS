In the iOS SDK, the EventBus provides notifications of event occuring inside the SDK. By setting up your app for EventBus callbacks, you can receive error notifications or take custom actions.

Use the following observer name types to receive notifications within your iOS app when the event occurs within the MarketingCloudSDK for iOS:

* kMarketingCloudSDKDidDisplayLocationMessageNotification - Sent whenever a local notification displays for a geofence or beacon.
* kMarketingCloudSDKDidReceiveGeofenceResponseNotification - Sent whenever the app downloads new geofences and messages from the Marketing Cloud.
* kMarketingCloudSDKDidReceiveBeaconResponseNotification - Sent whenever the app downloads new beacons and messages from the Marketing Cloud.
* kMarketingCloudSDKDidReceiveLocationUpdateNotification - Sent whenever the the app receives a new location from the OS.
* kMarketingCloudSDKDidReceiveCloudPagesNotification - Sent whenever the app downloads CloudPage messages from the Marketing Cloud.

Review these examples for all listed EventBus observer types.
