The Journey Builder for Apps SDK uses location capabilities to store end-user location data in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud database. You can use this information to target messages to a segmented group of contacts. The app pre-downloads geofence messages and triggers those messages when a mobile device crosses a geofence boundary. You must receive user permission to implement location services.

Note that the Salesforce Marketing Cloud must enable your account with access to MobilePush and Location Services in order to successfully use this functionality.
