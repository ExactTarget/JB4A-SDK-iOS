The Journey Builder for Apps SDK uses location capabilities monitor for entry and exit of Geofence locations to display notification messages. These fences and messages are created in the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. The SDK downloads geofences and their corresponding messages and triggers those messages when a mobile device crosses a geofence boundary. You must receive user permission to implement location services.

Note that the Salesforce Marketing Cloud must enable your account with access to MobilePush and Location Services in order to successfully use this functionality.
