To implement contact segmentation by tags, include code to set tags for subscriptions as defined by user choice.

You can use tags to collect information from the mobile app. Tags will appear in contact records for use in segmentation. Use tags for unstructured data or data that can contain many potential unknown values. For example, you can use tags when the number of potential attribute names exceeds the number of potential values of an individual attribute (such as the favorite brand specified by a contact). Because tags do not require linkage to an attribute present in the Marketing Cloud, you can assign whatever information you wish as part of the tag. 

The SDK trims all leading and trailings blanks from tag values.
