# Notes

The MobilePush SDK files used by the app were added into the Xcode project via references. For your own purposes you will want to take all the files located at https://github.exacttarget.com/Mobile/MobilePushSDK-iOS-Staging/tree/master/etpushsdk and place them inside your own app for referencing.
